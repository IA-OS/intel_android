This repo purpose is for research about intel bootimage.

But [osm0sis](https://github.com/osm0sis) tools is already support for intel bootimage from long ago so this repo just for archive only.

I was collecting this firmware from all platform except:
- Clover Trail "Z2760" [windows only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(system_on_a_chip)#Operating_system_support_on_Cloverview) (no android support)
- Morganfield "Willow Trail" and "Broxton" ([cancelled](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/cores/willow_trail))

Better implementation for inline building intel OSIP image based.
