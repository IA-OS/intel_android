This repo purpose is for research about intel bootimage.
- [[DEVS only] Unpacking RAZR i boot images](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/devs-only-unpacking-razr-i-boot-images.1972589)

But [osm0sis](https://github.com/osm0sis) tools is already support for intel bootimage from long ago so this repo just for archive only.
- [[TOOL] Android Image Kitchen - Unpack/Repack Kernel Ramdisk [Win/Android/Linux/Mac]](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/tool-android-image-kitchen-unpack-repack-kernel-ramdisk-win-android-linux-mac.2073775)

I was collecting this firmware from all platform except:
- Clover Trail "Z2760" windows only (no android support)
- Morganfield "Willow Trail" and "Broxton" ([cancelled](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/cores/willow_trail))
